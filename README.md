# Generative AI Tutorial

This repository contains the files I created while following the "Gen AI" course on Codedex.io. The tutorial is a introductory guide to generative AI, covering various models and techniques used by generative AI systems.

## helloworld.py

This script demonstrates a simple "Hello, world!" program to get started with Python programming.

## tokens.py

This script covers the concept of tokens in natural language processing (NLP) and how to tokenize text data. It performs simple word tokenization using the natural language toolkit (NLTK) library.

## ngrams.py

This script introduces n-grams, which are contiguous sequences of n items from a given text. It demonstrates how to generate n-grams from a text corpus using Python.

## text_classification.py

This script focuses on text classification tasks using machine learning techniques. It includes examples of how to preprocess text data, extract features, and train a classifier to categorize text into different classes using the `scikit-learn` library and Naive Bayes algorithm.

## spellcheck.py

This script implements a basic spell-checking algorithm from the TextBlob library. It demonstrates how TextBlob can be used to identify and correct misspelled words in a given text.

## machine_translation.py

This script explores machine translation using the Googletrans library. It shows how to translate text from one language to another programmatically.

## final_test.py

This script serves as a final test to evaluate the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the tutorial. It includes a task about analysing the sentiment of movie reviews using a Naive Bayes classifier model trained on sample data. The script tests the ability to preprocess text, extract features, and classify sentiment, providing a comprehensive review of the concepts covered in the tutorial.
